\section{Intro}
In the early nineties, \acs{GSM} was deployed in many European
countries. \ac{GSM} offered for the first time international
roaming for mobile subscribers. The \acs{GSM}'s use of \ac{TDMA} as
its communication standard was debated at length. And every now
and then there are big discussion whether \ac{CDMA} should have
been chosen over \ac{TDMA}.

\section{Furthermore}
\acresetall
The reader could have forgotten all the nice acronyms, so we repeat the
meaning again.

If you want to know more about \acf{GSM}, \acf{TDMA}, \acf{CDMA}
and other acronyms, just read a book about mobile communication. Just
to mention it: There is another \ac{UA}, just for testing purposes!

\subsection{Some chemistry and physics}
\label{Chem}
\ac{NAD+} is a major electron acceptor in the oxidation
of fuel molecules. The reactive part of \ac{NAD+} is its nictinamide
ring, a pyridine derivate.

One mol consists of \acs{NA} atoms or molecules. There is a relation
between the constant of Boltzmann and the \acl{NA}:
\begin{equation}
  k = R/\acs{NA}
\end{equation}

\acl{lox}/\acl{lh2} (\acsu{lox}/\acsu{lh2})

\subsection{Some testing fundamentals}
When testing \acp{IC}, one typically wants to identify functional
blocks to be tested separately. The latter are commonly indicated as
\acp{BUT}. To test a \ac{BUT} requires defining a testing strategy\dots

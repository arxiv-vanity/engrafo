// This is an attempt to simulate the way LaTeX does indents in PDFs.
// It goes something like this:
// - Within a section, first paragraph does not have indent
// - Subsequent paragraphs do have indents, but not anything within those paragraph.
//   So, for example, if there is a displayed formula, the text following it is not indented,
//   even though it looks like a new paragraph and is in a ltx_p
//
